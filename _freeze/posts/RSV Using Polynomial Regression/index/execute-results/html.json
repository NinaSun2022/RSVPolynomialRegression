It causes annual outbreaks of respiratory illnesses in all age groups. In most regions of the United States, RSV circulation starts in the fall and peaks in the winter, but the timing and severity of RSV season in a given community can vary from year to year. Scientists are developing several vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral therapies to help protect infants and young children, pregnant people (to protect their unborn babies), and older adults from severe RSV infection.\n\n## **Clinical Laboratory Testing**\n\nClinical symptoms of RSV are nonspecific and can overlap with other viral respiratory infections, as well as some bacterial infections. Several types of laboratory tests are available for confirming RSV infection. These tests may be performed on upper and lower respiratory specimens.\n\nThe most commonly used types of RSV clinical laboratory tests are\n\n-   Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which is more sensitive than culture and antigen testing\n\n-   Antigen testing, which is highly sensitive in children but not sensitive in adults\n\nLess commonly used tests include:\n\n-   Viral culture\n\n-   Serology, which is usually only used for research and surveillance studies\n\nSome tests can differentiate between RSV subtypes (A and B), but the clinical significance of these subtypes is unclear.\n\n## Structure of the assignment\n\n1.  Load RSV dataset\n\n2.  plot them in scatter plot/graph\n\n3.  Ensure the data is nonlinear and hence we are moving to polynomial regression.\n\n4.  prepare training and test data set\n\n5.  construct a polynomial regression model and ploy them in a graph using ggplot function\n\n6.  use K- means clustering to spilt the data to find which degree of polynomial suits our regression model.\n\n7.  construct a polynomial regression model.\n\n8.  Test the model with some values and find whether fall in the regression lines.\n\n9.
